## About this Project

The Cofundable API is a RESTful API written in python that serves as the backend for the Cofundable platform.

### Made With

<!-- TODO: Replace this list with your most critical dependencies -->

- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) - Dependency management library that makes creating and installing packages more streamlined.
- [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Automates and standardizes the creation of testing environments.
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) - Simplifies the design and execution of both unit and integration testing.
- [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - Autoformats code for consistent styling.
- [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) - Checks that code complies with PEP8 style guidelines.
- [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) - Checks that code follows idiomatic best practices for Python.
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) - Runs code quality checks before code is committed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python installed on your local machine, a version between 3.10 and 3.11
- Poetry installed on your local machine

In order to check that you have both Python and Poetry installed, run the following in your command line, and the output should look something like this:

> **NOTE**: in all of the code blocks below, lines preceded with $ indicate commands you should enter in your command line (excluding the $ itself), while lines preceded with > indicate the expected output from the previous command.

```
$ python --version && poetry --version
> Python 3.11.0
> Poetry version 1.1.6
```

**TROUBLESHOOTING:** If you receive an error message, or the version of python you have installed is not between 3.7 and 3.9, consider using a tool like [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) (on Mac/Linux) or [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) (on Windows) to manage multiple python installations.

If you have python installed but not poetry, follow these installation instructions:

- [Global install on Mac/Linux](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#osx--linux--bashonwindows-install-instructions)
- [Global install on Windows](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#windows-powershell-install-instructions)
- Local install inside a virtual environment using `pip` **NOTE:** This is not recommended because of potential package conflicts:
  - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv env`
  - Activate the virtual environment. **NOTE:** This virtual environment must be active any time you are working with this project:
    - Mac/Linux: `source env/bin/activate`
    - Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
  - Install poetry: `pip install poetry`

### Installation

1. [Clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) on your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/cofundable/cofundable-api.git`
1. Change directory into the cloned project: `cd cofundable-api`
1. Install the package: `poetry install`
1. Install `pre-commit` to autoformat your code: `poetry run pre-commit install`
1. Execute all tests: `poetry run tox`
1. All tests should pass with an output that ends in something like this:
   ```
    py39: commands succeeded
    lint: commands succeeded
    typecheck: commands succeeded
    pytest: commands succeeded
    coverage: commands succeeded
    congratulations :)
   ```
